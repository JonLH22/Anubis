# Anubis
Rewritten in Python version of minipwner
Anubis(AKA minipwner2.0) is:

This is taken in inspiration from https://github.com/nicholasadamou/minipwner which is a great tool. 
Basically, take a small router like a netgear and turn it into a pwn machine. 
I wanted to re-write the code in python to get better with python, and make it more ubiqitous. 
That minipwner only works on one router atm "A script to configure a TP-Link MR3040 running OpenWRT into a simple, yet powerful penetration-testing "drop box"." 
My intention is to be able to run it on any router that is compatible with OpenWRT.
